Java No-Argument Constructor Example
This Java code demonstrates the concept of a no-argument constructor using a Default class.

Overview
In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special method within a class that is used to initialize the object's state. A constructor is automatically invoked when an object of the class is created.

A no-argument constructor (or default constructor) is a constructor that takes no parameters. It is provided by the Java compiler if no constructors are defined explicitly within a class.

Code Explanation
Default Class (Default.java):

The Default class has two private data members: an integer a and a string b.
It defines a method Display that prints the values of a and b.
DefaultConstructor Class (DefaultConstructor.java):

The main method in this class demonstrates the concept of a no-argument constructor.
It creates an instance of the Default class using the no-argument constructor.
The Display method of the Default class is then called to print the default values of a and b.
Usage
Compile the Java code using a Java compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
Run the compiled program to observe the output, which demonstrates the use of a no-argument constructor.
Example Output
0:null
In this example, the default constructor of the Default class is invoked when creating an instance of the Default class. The default values of a and b are printed using the Display method.
